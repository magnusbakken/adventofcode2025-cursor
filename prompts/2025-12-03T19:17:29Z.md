# Prompt: 2025-12-03T19:17:29Z

## User Request

Add Cursor instruction files using the .cursor/rules directory structure with .mdc files.

General rules:
- Include the prompt used to create each change in a top-level directory called prompts/. Each file should be a markdown file named with the current date/time in ISO format.
- Give succinct answers.
- At the end of each response, add the emoji 🤖 to make it clear that the rules are being picked up.

Language specific rules:
- Use F# for all the tasks.
- Employ F# best practices. Prefer writing code in a pure functional style whenever possible.
- Prefer terse code, without deliberately being obfuscating.

Advent of code rules:
- Name each file dayNN.fsx, where NN is the 0-prefixed day number, starting with day01.fsx.
- Each day of Advent of Code has two parts. You will need to solve part 1 before being shown part 2.
- Each task will be given in a file called e.g. day01_part1.txt, day01_part2.txt, day02_part1.txt, etc.
- Each day has an associated input file, which will always be called day01_input.txt, day02_input.txt, etc.
- The output of each task should simply be a line of console output for part 1, and then another one for part 2.
