# Prompt: Solve day 2 part 2

Solve day 2 part 2

## Solution

Extended the Day 2 solution to handle Part 2, which changes the definition of "invalid" product IDs from patterns repeated exactly twice to patterns repeated at least twice (2 or more times).

- Added `isInvalidPart2` function that checks if a number can be formed by repeating some pattern at least 2 times
- Modified `findInvalidIds` to accept an `isInvalid` function as a parameter
- Computed both Part 1 and Part 2 results

Results:
- Part 1: 23560874270
- Part 2: 44143124633
