## Solution Summary
Created `day03.fsx` to solve Advent of Code Day 3 Part 1: "Lobby"

### Problem Understanding
- Each line represents a bank of batteries with digit labels (1-9)
- Must turn on exactly two batteries per bank (in order, no rearranging)
- The joltage produced is the two-digit number formed by the selected batteries
- Goal: Find maximum joltage for each bank and sum them all

### Algorithm
For each bank:
1. Try all pairs of positions (i, j) where i < j
2. Calculate joltage as digits[i] * 10 + digits[j]
3. Keep track of the maximum joltage found
4. Sum all maximum joltages across all banks

### Result
