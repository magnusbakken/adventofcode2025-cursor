# Solve day 3 part 2

For day 3 part 2 of Advent of Code, modify the code to select exactly 12 batteries from each bank to form the largest possible 12-digit number, then sum all the results.

The solution uses a greedy algorithm:
- For each position in the final 12-digit number (0-11)
- Look at a range of source positions that ensures we have enough digits remaining
- Choose the largest digit in that valid range
- Move past the chosen digit and continue

This ensures we maximize the leftmost digits first (most significant), which produces the largest overall number.
