# Prompt: Advent of Code Day 1 Part 2

## Task
Solve day 1 part 2 of Advent of Code.

## Solution Approach
Part 2 requires counting all times the dial points at 0, not just when it lands on 0 at the end of a rotation. This includes:
1. Times when the dial lands on 0 after a rotation (Part 1)
2. Times when the dial passes through 0 during a rotation

The key insight is to calculate how many times position 0 is encountered during each rotation:
- For right rotations (R) by distance D from position P: `(P + D) // 100` 
- For left rotations (L) by distance D from position P: `D // 100 + (1 if D % 100 > P else 0)`

## Results
- Part 1: 1031
- Part 2: 5828
