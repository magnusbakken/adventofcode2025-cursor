# Prompt: Advent of Code Day 1 Part 2

## Task
Solve day 1 part 2 of Advent of Code.

## Solution Approach
Part 2 requires counting all times the dial points at 0, not just when it lands on 0 at the end of a rotation. This includes times when the dial passes through 0 during a rotation.

The key insight is to calculate how many times position 0 is encountered during each rotation:
- For **right rotations** by distance D from position P: `(P + D) / 100`
- For **left rotations** by distance D from position P:
  - If P = 0: `D / 100` (first hit is at 100 clicks, then 200, etc.)
  - If P > 0 and D >= P: `(D - P) / 100 + 1` (hit at P clicks, then P+100, etc.)
  - If P > 0 and D < P: `0` (never reach 0)

The logic is based on counting positions visited: P-1, P-2, ..., P-D (mod 100), and determining when these equal 0.

## Results
- Part 1: 1031
- Part 2: 5831
